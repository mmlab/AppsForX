AppsForX WordPress plugin
=========================

![Apps4X WordPress](../master/meta/wplogo.png)

Introduction
------------

This is a WordPress plugin which enables event organizers to manage their events.
People can submit ideas to these events.

Example: OKFN Belgium organized a hackathon. This hackathon had a jury and awards that were offered to the participants. 
People were able to submit ideas for this hackathon, like a "GitHub Livefeed". 
The plugin should then be able to handle the aspects of adding/editing/submitting ideas and events.

This plugin aims to be conform the [apps4eu](https://github.com/mmlab/apps4eu-vocabulary/) ontology.
This means that the publicly viewable pages using this plugin will contain the corresponding RDFa tags for the vocabulary.
It was built for the [Apps for Europe](http://appsforeurope.eu/) project.
